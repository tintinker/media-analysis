GRANDVIEW, Mo. (AP) — No charges will be filed over the deadly police shooting of a sword-
wielding suburban Kansas City man.

Larry
T he Kansas City Star reports that prosecutors found that the officer who killed 60-year-old Larry
San N icolas
San Nicolas  acted out of reasonable fear. T he shooting happened in July after police in Grandview
received a 911 call. San Nicolas was suffering a manic diabetic reaction, and his family wanted him
subdued so he could get medical assistance.

But authorities say San Nicolas ignored the officers' commands to stay back and kept walking
toward them with two large swords, even after being hit with bean-bag rounds. T he officer who
fatally shot San Nicolas can be heard muttering, "God please, no, no, no," before opening fire.

His wife, Jessie San Nicolas, described the shooting as "a nightmare."
