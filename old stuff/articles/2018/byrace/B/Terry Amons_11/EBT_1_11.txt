as a 43-year-old Antioch resident by the Contra Costa County Coroner's office on Tuesday. 

Police identified Terry Amons, 43, of Antioch as the man police fatally shot on Jan. 12. 

At an undisclosed time that night, police were called to Nation's Giant Hamburgers at 3789 Railroad Ave. after a

resident reported seeing an alleged drug transaction. 

Several minutes later, police arrived and found a vehicle that matched the community member's description. Two

police officers approached the vehicle, and saw a handgun in the center console of the car and told Amons to

place his hands on the steering wheel. 

Amons did as police instructed, but later dropped his right arm in what police have said was an attempt to retrieve

the gun from the center console. Amons raised his hand back up and one of the officers fired. 

Officers provided first aid, but Amons later died at John Muir Hospital. 

The officer has been identified by police as Dillon Tindall, who had served with the Contra Costa Sheriff's Office for

over two years before transferring to the Pittsburg Police Department nine months ago. 

As of this time, police have not said whether drugs were found on Amons' person or in his vehicle. There is no

indication of how many shots were fired. 

Amons' family members disputed this account. 

"I'm saddened by this entire situation, especially to how things played out," said his cousin, Laurie Bardell. "The

whole scenario was off. Terry was not selling drugs. There were no drugs found on him." 

Contra Costa County requires a coroner's inquest hearing every time there is an officer-involved fatality. Pittsburg

police have launched a joint investigation with the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office.
