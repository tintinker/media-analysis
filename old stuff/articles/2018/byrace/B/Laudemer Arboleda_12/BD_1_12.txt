officer-involved shooting over the weekend. 

The East Bay Times reports Monday Contra Costa Sheriff's spokesman Jimmy Lee identified the shooting victim

as 33-year-old Laudemer Arboleda, of Newark, and said an autopsy will take place Tuesday. 

Lee identified as the officer as Deputy Andrew Hall. Hall has served with the department for five years and is

currently assigned to the city of Danville. 

He says police responded Saturday to a report from a resident of a suspicious person near downtown Danville. 

Lee says Laudemer drove away, leading officers on a short pursuit. He says Hall got out of the patrol car and

opened fire when the suspect accelerated toward him.
