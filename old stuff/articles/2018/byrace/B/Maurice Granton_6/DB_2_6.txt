lawyer for the man’s family said the video also shows that Maurice Granton, 24, was unarmed. “If you’re a young

man in the city of Chicago, do not run from the Chicago police,” said attorney Antonio Romanucci. “Maurice did not

have a weapon in his hand when he was shot.” The video does show officers talking about a weapon nearby, and a

gun was found about 20 feet away from Granton. The Chicago Police Department has said that Granton fired at

officers before he was shot. The Chicago Tribune reports that officer Sheldon Thrasher, who is African-American,

shot Granton. He and another officer at the scene are back on active duty following a 30-day leave. The shooting is

still being investigated.
