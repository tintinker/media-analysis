DANVILLE — T he 25-year-old Danville man shot dead by police early Sunday had threatened to kill
himself just moments before he was gunned down, court records show.

Court documents also note that four shell casings were found at the scene, suggesting that four
shots were fired by police officers that morning. Juan Markee Jones
Juan Markee Jones  was shot twice in the chest,
but it is not known how many officers shot him.

Police body-camera video shows officers firing at Jones as he abruptly whirls toward them with
arms outstretched by his chest. T he incident followed a call to emergency dispatchers about the
domestic assault of a man on a woman.

Just moments before that final confrontation, Jones made a phone call to the woman who
reported an assault, and "told her not to press charges against him and he reminded her that he
would not go back to prison he would kill himself first," reads a search warrant affidavit filed in
Danville Circuit Court on T uesday.

It could not be determined if Jones had a prison sentence in his criminal background. Jones had an
assault case pending in Danville General District Court when he died, court records show. He was
arrested Jan. 29 and charged with misdemeanor assault, as well as two counts of threats over a
telephone. He was accused of threatening a woman with a gun, court records show, and had a
hearing set for T uesday, just two days after he died.
