A KNIFE-WIELDING Bronx man who was shot dead by cops last month spent his final frantic

knife (photo) he was brandishing, said Inspector Kevin Maloney, who heads the NYPD's Force
Investigation Division.

Although the audio is hard to make out, the video shows that the suspect - who earlier had tried to
stab his landlord with a smaller knife in an argument over unpaid rent - told cops to shoot him eight
times during the encounter, police said.

Police stopped short of characterizing the incident as suicide by cop.

top spokesman. "[But] I can't get into the guy's mind."

As city policy demands, the Bronx District Attorney' office is investigating the shooting, as is the
NYPD.

But Police Commissioner James O'Neill two days after the shooting said he had viewed the video
and believes the cops acted appropriately.
