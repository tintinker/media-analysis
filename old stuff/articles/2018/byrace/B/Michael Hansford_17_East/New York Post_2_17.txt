"Drop the knife! Drop the f--king knife!" one officer orders. Instead of complying, Hansford faces
the cops as he yells, "Shoot me!" T he officer fires four times.

T he video cuts to the second officer, who yells, "Hands up!" Hansford again yells,"Shoot me!"
before the cop fires at him twice and the video ends.

T he landlord had given Hansford two weeks' notice to move out of his Prospect Avenue
apartment for failing to keep up with his rent.

Cops did not identify the officers involved. T he incident remains under review by the Bronx District
Attorney's Office.
