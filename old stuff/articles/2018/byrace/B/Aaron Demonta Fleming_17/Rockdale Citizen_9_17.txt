Cooper said in a 2013 interview.As a result of his work as an EMT , he got to know several
members of the Police Department, who suggested he join the force."I wanted to be in law
enforcement because I simply wanted to help people who were in need," Cooper said. "In EMT  and
the Police Academy, we were taught to be a servant of the public, and I try to be that."Law
