shooter remains at large, police reportedly said. A police officer that responded to the shooting at the Riverchase

Galleria in Hoover—which left a 12 and 18-year-old injured—fatally shot Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford after arriving

on the scene. While authorities initially claimed that Bradford had shot at the victims, they said Friday new

evidence had emerged that clashed with their initial assessment. “We regret that our initial media release was not

totally accurate, but new evidence indicates that it was not,” Hoover Police Capt. Gregg Rector said in a statement.

Rector explained Bradford might have had some involvement in the dispute leading up to the shooting—and that

he was “brandishing a handgun”—but probably didn’t fire the shots that struck the 18-year-old.
