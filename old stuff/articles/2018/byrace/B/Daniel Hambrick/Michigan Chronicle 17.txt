Delke surrendered to authorities but was released shortly on $25,000 bond. Meanwhile, the local
police union has vowed to fight to the end in the officer's defense.

On July 26, Delke approached the vehicle Hambrick was in, saying he believed it was the same car
he said he saw earlier that day driving erratically, according to police investigators. Hambrick and
two others fled from the officer.

Surveillance video, released by the prosecutor, showed 25-year-old Delke chasing Hambrick. T he
officer opens fire on Hambrick, who did not appear to turn toward Delke. After firing multiple
times, the officer circled the dying man while continuing to point his weapon at him.

T he Nashville Fraternal Order of Police argued that Delke was defending himself because he saw
Hambrick holding a handgun during the chase. However, the video did not appear to show
Hambrick carrying a weapon.

It's rare for a Nashville police officer to face homicide charges in the line of duty. T hat hasn't
happened for decades, according to the newspaper.

In fact, Delke almost avoided the homicide charge when a magistrate judge told the district
attorney earlier on Thursday that he presented insufficient evidence. But a general session judge
reversed that ruling.
