NASHVILLE, T enn. (AP) — A judge has ruled that multiple court documents from legal discovery will
be filed under seal in the case against a white Nashville police officer who fatally shot an armed
black man from behind in July.

In Officer Andrew Delke's case, Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins on T uesday
cited state Supreme Court precedent, which says many pretrial discovery records would likely
impair a defendant's fair trial rights if made public.

Nashville District Attorney General Glenn Funk wanted the documents public, saying Delke's case
doesn't warrant sealing of discovery previously reserved for Nashville criminal court cases involving
child victims or rape.

Defense attorney David Raybin said making the documents public would let the case be tried
through news coverage.

Delke is charged with first-degree murder in 25-year-old Daniel H ambrick

Daniel H ambrick's death.
