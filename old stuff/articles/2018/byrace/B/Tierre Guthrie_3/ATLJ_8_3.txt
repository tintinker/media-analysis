 
Feb. 20--Two Henry County deputies shot during a fatal gun battle while serving an arrest warrant are both

recovering at home now, officials said. 

Deputy Michael Corley has been recuperating at home and Deputy Ralph "Sid" Callaway was released from Atlanta

Medical Center following the memorial service for Locust Grove police Officer Chase Maddox, who died in the Feb.

9 shootout. 

Hundreds attended the funeral for Maddox, a 26-year-old who was killed while assisting the Henry County

deputies. He had worked for the department for nearly five years and was the first Locust Grove officer hired

immediately after graduation from the police academy, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported. 

The GBI is investigating the shooting, which occurred at the Hawthorne at Linden Park subdivision in Locust Grove. 

The man wanted for failure to appear on a traffic violation, 39-year-old Tierre Guthrie, was killed on the scene. 

Callaway was shot just below his bulletproof vest and had emergency surgery, Henry County Sheriff Keith

McBrayer said. The man couldn't eat solid food for several days. 

Making the memorial for Maddox was important to Callaway, McBrayer said.
