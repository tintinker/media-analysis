The man accused of killing a Locust Grove police officer and wounding two deputies had been served an eviction

notice nine days earlier, according to Henry County Sheriff Keith McBrayer. 

Tierre Guthrie, 39, failed to appear in court last week after being cited for illegally parking a commercial vehicle, his

arrest warrant states. He could have paid a fine and avoided going to jail, McBrayer told Channel 2 Action News. 

Instead, Guthrie spoke to deputies in language used by sovereign citizens, or those who donâ€™t believe they have to

abide by government regulations, McBride said. Guthrie shot the deputies and Maddox, who later died. Deputies

returned fire and shot Guthrie, who died at the scene.
