A Franklin County grand jury decided not to indict a Columbus police officer who killed a man
suspected of slaying three people in April, according to a press release from county Prosecutor
Ron O'Brien.

Abadi Gebregziber on April 30 after the man attempted to flee the

Sgt. Gregg Seevers shot Abadi Gebreg ziber
scene, a townhouse in the 4400 block of Walford Street, where three women had been stabbed.
T wo of those women -- Gebregziber's estranged wife, 33-year-old Azeb Demewez, and Russom
Habte, 19 -- died. Another man, Selam Habte, was found dead in an apartment on the 2100 block
of Fitzroy Drive.

Police ordered Gebregziber to drop his knife outside the apartment on Walford Street where
officers had been dispatched to, but he ran off with the knife and was shot once by Seevers.
Gebregziber fell but attempted to throw his knife at an officer before a stun gun was used on him.
T he release said the shooting was captured on an officer's body camera.

O'Brien's office presented the case to the grand jury, as is routine for officer-involved shootings.
