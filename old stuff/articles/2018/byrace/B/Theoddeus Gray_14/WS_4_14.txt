St. Clair Shores police responded Sunday night to a report of a man with a rifle outside Lakeland Manor, where

there was a gathering of about 70 people. When K-9 officer Axe was sent to track a fleeing suspect, police said the

man shot the dog with a handgun. Police say officers then fired, striking the man. The man and police dog were

taken for treatment and both were later pronounced dead. The sheriff's office identified the man as 29-year-old

Theoddeus Gray of Detroit.
