PHILADELPHIA (AP) — T he Philadelphia District Attorney's office says no charges will be filed in the
death of a man shot by police in his home after he fired at them, apparently mistaking them for
intruders.

Authorities said members of the SWAT  team were seeking the grandson of 59-year-old Ricardo
Ricardo
Gidding s  on a weapons violation when they entered the Germantown residence Aug. 6.

Police say Giddings fired four rounds from a stairway, striking an officer, and was killed by another
officer's return fire. Giddings' wife was shot in the abdomen and hospitalized. T he grandson being
sought later turned himself in.

Prosecutors said Tuesday the shooting was justified because the officer "reasonably believed he
was in danger of death or serious bodily injury.

Police commissioner Richard Ross called the shooting "an all-out, absolute tragedy."
