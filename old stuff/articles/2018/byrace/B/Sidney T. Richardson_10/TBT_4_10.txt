being tased.  

Officers arrived at 1805 Marvy Ave. in north Tampa after receiving a call regarding a man threatening a relative

with a machete, according to a Tampa Police Department news release.  

Sidney T. Richardson IV was in a room with his 17-year-old cousin, Jessica Marsh, when police ordered Richardson

to drop the weapon several times. Even after a taser was deployed, Richardson held on to the machete, police said.

 

 

Police feared for Marsh's safety and their own, the release stated.  

One officer fired his weapon at Richardson, killing him. Neither Marsh nor the officers were injured.  

The officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, which is standard

practice, according to the release.
