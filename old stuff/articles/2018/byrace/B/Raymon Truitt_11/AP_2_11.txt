Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent in Gary, Indiana is in custody.  

The U.S. Justice Department announced that 25-year-old Bernard Graham of Calumet City, Illinois surrendered

Saturday afternoon.  

Investigators say three men ambushed federal agents on Thursday during an illegal weapons investigation in Gary,

Indiana, just southeast of Chicago. A Chicago-based ATF agent was shot and critically wounded.  

Chicago ATF Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez says the agent is expected to make a full recovery.  

Graham and 19-year-old Blake King have been charged with assaulting a federal officer and carrying and

discharging a firearm in the furtherance of a crime.  

Twenty-eight-year-old Raymon Truitt of Gary was shot to death during the incident.
