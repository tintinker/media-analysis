T he Smyrna man shot by a Maine State Police sergeant during an armed confrontation at the
T hriftway convenience store in Oakfield on Friday has died.

Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said John Corneil
Saturday at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor.

John Corneil, 54, died

An autopsy was being conducted Sunday at the state Medical Examiner's Office in Augusta,
McCausland said in a press release.

T hree troopers went to the store on Ridge Road in Oakfield, an Aroostook County town west of
Houlton, to try to arrest Corneil on warrants for assault, criminal threatening, terrorizing and
reckless conduct in an incident earlier in the week in Smryna.

As customers watched, Corneil threatened the troopers with what appeared to be a handgun. Sgt.
Chad Fuller, a 20-year veteran of the state police, shot Corneil. Corneil was using what was later
determined to be a pellet gun that looked like a semi-automatic pistol, McCausland said.

T he Maine Attorney General's Office continues to investigate the incident, which is standard in all
police-involved shootings, he said.
