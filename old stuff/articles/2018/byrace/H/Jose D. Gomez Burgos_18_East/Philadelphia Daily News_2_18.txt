Bucks County District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub said Friday that he found that two Bristol
T ownship police officers were justified in fatally shooting a stabbing suspect who allegedly was
wielding a hatchet earlier this month.

Jose Gomez- Burg os
Jose Gomez- Burg os , 29, of New York City, was shot three times and died on March 2 after he
allegedly emerged from a stolen vehicle parked on Edgely Road near Runway Road in Bristol
T ownship with a raised hatchet. Officers David Wiser and Patrick Kitchenman ordered him to stop
and drop the weapon, but Gomez-Burgos did not heed their commands and was within 5 to 8 feet
from the officers when they opened fire, Weintraub said.

After shooting Gomez-Burgos, the officers found that he also was holding a knife hidden in his left
hand, Weintraub said. T he district attorney's decision was aided by two videos recorded by
cameras on police vehicles, Weintraub said.

T he officers were "fully justified" in firing their weapons, he said. Burgos-Gomez was wanted by
New York City police for stabbing the mother of his children earlier that day.
