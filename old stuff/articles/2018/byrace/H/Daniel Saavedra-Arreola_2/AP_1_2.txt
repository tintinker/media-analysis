police as a wanted ex-felon. 

A police spokesman said Friday the man has been confirmed to be Daniel Saavedra-Arreola. 

Gilbert Gallegos says Saavedra-Arreola had several aliases and served time in various correctional facilities. 

According to police, officers responding to a residential burglary call last Sunday were confronted by a suspect

with a weapon. 

At least one officer opened fire, fatally wounding him. 

A task force is investigating the officer-involved shooting. 

Gallegos says Saavedra-Arreola's past convictions include conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. 

At the time of the shooting, he was wanted for probation violations and considered armed and dangerous.
