PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Authorities in Rhode Island have recommended changes for police
chases in response to a fatal officer-involved shooting on Interstate 95 last year.

WPRI-T V reports T HAT  he Providence Police Department called for "training between agencies" to
address tactical and safety issues. T he department also found that communication between
officers was good but that talks broke down with Rhode Island Hospital personnel. Officials say the
hospital pulled resources because the incident wasn't clear.

Police say police began chasing Donald Morgan after he stole a police cruiser while he was being
transported to an arraignment. Morgan ditched the cruiser, and state police received a tip that he
may have climbed into a white pickup truck.

T roopers engaged in a high-speed pursuit with a white pickup and opened fire, killing 32-year-old
Joseph Santos .
