shooting of an unarmed man 10 days earlier, that's because data show it is a rare event. 

In recent years, police have shot and killed roughly 1,000 people a year, said Philip M. Stinson, a Bowling Green

University criminologist who tracks deadly police shootings. Since 2005, he said, 90 police officers, state troopers

or deputy sheriffs have been charged with murder or manslaughter, an average of about seven cases a year

nationwide. 

Of those 90 officers, 32 have been convicted - 16 by guilty plea and 16 by jury trial, Stinson said. 

The Lehigh Valley saw its first such charges in years Tuesday when Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin on

Tuesday charged officer Jonathan Roselle, 33, with voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Joseph

Santos, 44, of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. Roselle shot Santos, who was not armed, July 28 on Hamilton Boulevard,

across from Dorney Park. 

manslaughter. 

The charge Roselle faces is one that more frequently ends in conviction, according to Stinson's data. When police

are convicted, Stinson said, it's usually a charge of manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary

According to the data, 41 of the 90 officers charged fought their cases in court and walked out free. According to

Stinson, 21 were acquitted at a jury trial, nine were acquitted at a bench trial, six cases were dismissed by a

prosecutor, four were dismissed by a judge and in one case, no true bill was returned from a grand jury. 

The remaining cases are pending, he said. 

or death, he said. 

An officer is justified in using deadly force if the officer has a "reasonable apprehension" of imminent bodily injury

Stinson's data show that murder or manslaughter cases against police since 2005 usually amounted to single

digits nationwide, and then spiked to 18 in 2015. It reached 16 a year later, and then fell to six last year. His records

show five cases so far in 2018. 

Stinson, a former police officer, said the data is up to date as of Monday. 

The charge against Roselle comes as the number of deadly shootings of unarmed people by police is trending

downward, according to The Washington Post. The newspaper has been keeping a nationwide database of fatal

police shootings since the 2015 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. 

According to the Post report from May, police in 2015 shot and killed 94 unarmed people. The number of unarmed

people killed by police bobbed from 51 in 2016 to 68 in 2017, it said. 

At the time of the report, 18 unarmed people, eight fewer than at the same time last year, died by a police shooting

this year. 

A researcher who reviewed the Post's data said he'd need more data before he could say it's a long-term trend. But

Justin Nix of the University of Nebraska at Omaha said a combination of factors, including implicit bias training

and a "Ferguson effect" - a concern over shooting an unarmed person - may have a cumulative impact on police

officers' approach to potential shooting situations. 

At least for the last three years, Nix said, the decline has been "certainly noticeable." 

The last local case that was ruled an unjustifiable use of deadly force was in 2015, when a grand jury decided that

constable Howard "Chip" Altemos unjustifiably shot Kevin McCullers of Whitehall Township, who was wanted for

unpaid parking tickets. Altemos pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of recklessly endangering another

person and was ordered to serve two years of probation. 

One of the last cases in which a local officer was jailed in a shooting case was former Easton police officer Scott

Cameron, who served 18 months after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the killing of John Rapp in
