 
July 31--Numerous organizations are uniting for a protest Wednesday night at the spot where Joseph Santos was

shot and killed by a South Whitehall Township police officer Saturday. 

Scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at Lincoln Avenue and Hamilton Boulevard, the protest is being organized by Make the

Road PA, which advocates for Latino communities, along with the Allentown NAACP; the Allentown Coalition for

Economic Dignity; the faith-based Nehemiah Collaborative; NextGen Pennsylvania, a political action group;

Women's March, Pennsylvania chapter; and Juventud en Camino, a human services organization. 

An officer responding to a "mental issue" around 5:45 p.m. fired five shots when Santos failed to follow the

officer's repeated commands to "get on the ground," videos of the shooting show. 

Santos, 44, of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., did not appear to be armed in the videos. 

In a prepared statement, Ashleigh Strange, spokesperson for Make the Road PA, called the shooting "senseless"

and an "act of extreme police brutality." 

"Our members stand with the family and all families that face brutality at the hands of an overzealous and

destructive police force." the statement said. "We remain vigilant while we wait for more details." 

On a Facebook page for "Lehigh Valley: End Police Brutality," more than 200 people responded by early Tuesday

afternoon that they would attend the protest. 

The officer, who was put on paid leave, has not been identified. 

State police and the Lehigh County Homicide Task Force police are investigating the shooting.
