Jose Pietri was killed by officers around 9 a.m. in Millville, ending a bloody morning that began
miles away in Camden County.

T he carnage started early Saturday when police responded to a 911 call about a shooting at a
home on Woodhaven Way in Winslow.

woman seriously wounded.

missing. It’s unclear if one of the shooting victims was also a parent of the missing children.

Following the shooting, Winslow officers said they saw Pietri’s vehicle near the crime scene and
pursued him.

cop on Holly Berry Lane.

Officials have not described what led to the shooting, but Pietri was declared dead at a hospital a
short time later. Prosecutors said a firearm was recovered near his body.

not said how they got there.

T he Cumberland County Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the fatal shooting by the officers.

Details about what led to the Winslow shootings have not been released.

T he unidentified Winslow woman shot Saturday remains hospitalized, authorities said.
