T he Missouri State Highway Patrol has ruled a Jasper County Sheriff's Deputy was justified in
shooting a Joplin man who investigators say charged deputies with a knife in a home in Joplin on Jan.
2.

T he shooting victim, Louis C. M iller

Louis C. M iller, 66, died of a single gunshot wound.

T he Sheriff's Office said the Patrol cleared Deputy Jason Hutchins of any wrong-doing in the
incident.

According to a written statement released by the Sheriff's Office on Friday, the investigation into
the shooting was immediately turned over to the Patrol, and the results were returned this week to
the Sheriff's Office and Jasper County Prosecutor.

T he report says Hutchins responded to 901 N. Landreth Avenue at about 3 p.m., Jan. 2, when
deputies with the Sheriff's Office Civil Process Division called for help regarding a man in the home
with a knife.

Civil Process officers were attempting to serve an order of protection to Miller at the home.

"Upon contacting him at the residence he picked up a large knife," the Sheriff's Office said in its
statement on Friday. "Deputies gave repeated commands for Miller to drop the knife. Miller
pointed the knife in their direction and charged at them. Deputy Hutchins fired one shot, striking
Miller in the chest. He died from the wound."
