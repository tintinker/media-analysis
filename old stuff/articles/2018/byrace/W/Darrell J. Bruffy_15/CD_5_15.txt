An honor escort of law enforcement officers was there to greet Franklin County Sheriff's Deputy

Darrell B ruf f y, 55, of Orient, on Harrisburg Pike and Eakin

Heaberlin had begun pursuing Bruffy, who was driving a Ford F-250 pickup truck erratically and had
struck a vehicle in the area of Bohnburg Avenue and Big Run Bluffs Boulevard on Columbus' West
Side before taking off. Heaberlin tried to stop the pickup near Clime Road, but Bruffy kept going.

Bruffy ran his pickup into a utility pole in front of a Shell station at the corner of Harrisburg Pike and
Eakin. Heaberlin, with gun drawn, approached the driver's side and ordered Bruffy to get out of the
car, according to eyewitnesses.

What followed was three separate bursts totaling more than 30 shots in less than a minute. Both
Heaberlin and Bruffy were down. T he bullet that struck Heaberlin hit just below his armored vest.

Heaberlin had been in OhioHealth Grant Medical Center since the shootout. Other Franklin County
deputies, along with officers from the Columbus Police Traffic Control Motorcycle Unit, gave him
an honor escort home, according to a sheriff's office post on social media.
