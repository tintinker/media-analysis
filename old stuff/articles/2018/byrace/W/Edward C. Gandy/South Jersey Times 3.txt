Edward C. Gandy
Edward C. Gandy Jr., a man with a history of mental health issues, was pacing in an empty lot at
North High and McNeal streets in Millville when a police sedan pulled up.

Gandy had called the police, told them he had a loaded gun and said, “I’m feeling homicidal.”

When Gandy saw the police car, he started walking toward it. It’s a methodical march that never
stops, according to new dash cam video the Cumberland County Prosecutor’s Office released of
the Jan. 22 event.

Gandy’s hands went behind his back, then stretched out in front of him, as if he planned to shoot
the officer. As Gandy continued his determined walk across the street, closer to the cruiser,
Patrolman Colt Gibson called him by his name and told him to stop and to show his hands.

Gandy’s arms went behind his back again, and this time he motioned as if to take something out of
his back pocket, and then pointed his hands again at the officers as if he has a weapon.

Gibson fired his department-issued rifle and at least two shots rang out. Gandy slumped to the
ground and an officer called for an ambulance.

Millville police are not authorized to speak about the shooting. Cumberland County Prosecutor
Jennifer Webb-McRae has not commented beyond the initial news release.

According to a use-of-force report, Gibson fired two shots at Gandy, saying Gandy had
“threatened officer with a firearm.”
