FORT  DODGE, Iowa (AP) — T he Webster County attorney has cleared two officers who killed a
man during an exchange of gunfire.

M atthew H urley, of Wall Lake, died Dec. 31 after engaging in a gunfight while
Forty-five-year-old Matthew H urley
driving away from officers who had been called to a disturbance just outside Fort Dodge. Hurley's
vehicle eventually stopped in a field, and he was found dead inside.

including deadly force, in that each reasonably believed that such force was necessary to defend
himself or another from an actual or imminent use of unlawful force by Matthew Thomas Hurley."
