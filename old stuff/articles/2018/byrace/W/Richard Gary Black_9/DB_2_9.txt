defending his Colorado home from a naked intruder, Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz said during a Thursday

press conference. Describing the “incredibly chaotic situation,” Metz said that when Black’s wife called 911, she

told the operator that the intruder had a gun and provided no description of the attacker who was in the bathroom

with her grandson. When police arrived to the scene, they saw a man holding a gun and a flashlight near bathroom,

Metz said. Officers told him to put his gun down four times, but he didn’t comply. When Black—who had shot and

killed the intruder after the man tried to drown his grandson in the bathtub—entered the main room of the house

and started walking towards police, an officer shot him four times. He later died from his injuries at a local

hospital. Police then found the intruder, Dajon Harper, dead on the bathroom floor and the grandson still alive in

the bathtub. It then became clear to police that Black had shot Harper before police entered the scene. Metz told

reporters that Black was hard of hearing, so he may not have heard officers’ orders to drop his weapon. The police

chief also “strongly disputed” the notion that the officer involved in the shooting was acting recklessly, and said

that he had completed all the required training to return to work after he was involved in another shooting in late

June.
