 
Jan. 22--A man fatally shot by Dunwoody police Saturday was a suspect in an armed robbery, the GBI said

Monday. 

Jason Lappe, 44, allegedly broke into a register at a Kroger on Holcomb Bridge Road in Johns Creek about 7:45

a.m., GBI spokesman Bahan Rich said. He was armed with a handgun and ran from the store after the alleged

robbery, Dunwoody police Sgt. Robert Parsons previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 

A witness followed Lappe to a shopping center parking lot in the 5000 block of Winters Chapel Road, where

Dunwoody and Johns Creek police identified him as the robbery suspect, Parsons said. 

"When confronted by officers, the suspect did not comply with their verbal commands and exited the vehicle,"

Parsons said. "Fearing for his safety and the safety of others, an officer fired one shot, striking the suspect." 

Lappe was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he died. 

The officer who shot Lappe was placed on administrative leave. An investigation is ongoing.
