 
May 09--A state trooper was justified when he fatally shot a Mertztown man, 26, after he tried to shoplift at a

Walmart near Trexlertown, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said Wednesday. 

Martin said Trooper Brian Bird acted within the law when he mortally wounded Aaron Ibrahem shortly after 9 p.m.

March 28 in the parking lot of the store in Lower Macungie Township, a few miles from the Berks line. 

Martin, whose office investigated the incident, said that Bird fired at Ibrahem only after Ibrahem had pointed and

tried to fire a semi-automatic gun at the trooper during a foot chase. During the chase, Martin said, Ibrahem failed

to comply with commands to stop. 

According to state police: 

Ibrahem abandoned a full cart after seeing a trooper had entered the store. He ran from the trooper and pulled a

semi-automatic pistol out of his waistband, firing it once without hitting anyone. 

Ibrahem got into his van and again pointed the gun at Bird about 45 feet away. Bird fired nine times at Ibrahem

through the door and window, striking him seven times. Troopers said witnesses and surveillance videos from the

parking lot supported the trooper's account. No one else was hurt.
