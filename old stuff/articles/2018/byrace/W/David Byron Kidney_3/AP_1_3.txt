also left two troopers injured. 

Police say preliminary results from an autopsy Thursday showed 62-year-old David Kidney of Union City died of a

single gunshot wound sustained while exchanging gunfire with troopers. 

Detective Sgt. Aaron Steensma and Trooper Daniel Thayer were executing a search warrant when they were shot

Wednesday morning in Union Township, south of Battle Creek. Steensma was struck in the chest and remained in

serious but stable condition Thursday at a hospital. Thayer suffered a grazing would to his hand but his ballistic

vest stopped a slug that struck his chest. 

Police say the two troopers were trying to take cover when Kidney shot them. The warrant was from a cold case

investigation.
