LANCAST ER, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania prosecutor says a police officer was justified in shooting a
man who confronted officers with a shotgun outside a township police station.

LNP newspaper reports that Lancaster County's district attorney said 65-year-old John Simson
East Petersburg arrived at the Manheim Township police station May 8 with the weapon, upset
after being charged four days earlier with sexually assaulting a minor.

John Simson of

District Attorney Craig Stedman said Simson refused to comply with police commands and shot
himself in the face before the officer fired a fatal single shot. He said the man had written a suicide
note to his family earlier.

Stedman said there was no question in his mind that "the officer was justified in what he did."
