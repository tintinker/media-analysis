Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman will say today whether a fatal shot fired by a
Manheim Township police officer earlier this month was an appropriate use of force.

Courthouse at noon.

An East Petersburg man was killed by a single shot from the officer after a confrontation outside
the Manheim Township police station May 8.

Officials said the man, 65-year-old John Simson
Simson shot himself in the face before the officer returned a fatal, single shot, according to
Lancaster Count Coroner Dr. Stephen Diamantoni.

John Simson, arrived at the station armed with a shotgun.

Simson was not fully incapacitated by the self-inflicted wound, and he posed a threat to officers
and people in the area of the police station, the district attorney's office has said.

Simson had been charged a few days prior with sexually abusing a young girl. He was arraigned on
the charges and posted bail.

T he officer, who has not been identified, has been on paid, administrative leave since the shooting.

fires a gun.
