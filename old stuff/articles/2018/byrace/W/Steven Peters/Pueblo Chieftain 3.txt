T he Pueblo Police Department released the names of the two officers involved in the March 6
officer-involved shooting of 55-year-old Steven Peters
DeCesaro and Adam Quintana.

Steven Peters  on Friday, identifying them as T homas

T he officers have returned to full duty following the shooting investigation in which Peters
reportedly led them on a brief chase that ended with him producing a handgun and being shot and
killed by DeCesaro and Quintana.

T hey had been called to the 900 block of East Ninth Street to investigate a report of a restraining
order violation when a female caller reported that Peters was refusing to leave her home and was
carrying a handgun.

Peters reportedly left the woman's residence on a bicycle and when officers approached him at a
nearby intersection, refused to comply with their commands and reportedly reached for his
waistband.

Police say the officers deployed a stun gun on Peters but were unable to subdue him, at which
point he began running.

After a short foot chase through the yards of neighboring homes, the officers found him in the
backyard of a home on the 900 block of East Eighth Street.

It was at this point Peters allegedly produced a handgun, prompting the two officers to fire their
weapons. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

T he event marked the second officer-involved shooting in Pueblo of 2018, which has since
increased to three.

Another officer-involved shooting took place earlier this week, as 35-year-old Matthew Gregg was
shot after firing multiple rounds at police from a handgun.

Gregg was listed in critical condition as of Tuesday but police were unable to provide an update on
his condition Friday.
