A man armed with a BB gun who was killed by police inside a Panera Bread restaurant last month
raised his gun and pointed it in the direction of the officers before he was fatally shot in the head
and upper torso, according to video released by authorities Monday to media outlets.

surveillance video from inside the restaurant in Princeton.

T he five-minute video shows a split screen of two vantage points inside the restaurant. One is
from behind an officer, who is pointing an M4 rifle at Scott M ielentz
handgun at his waist. T he other angle is a side view of Mielentz.

Scott Mielentz , who is seen holding a

Mielentz, 56, was shot after he kept authorities at bay for five hours on March 21. Customers and
employees escaped the building, and no one else was injured.

T he shooting remains under investigation. T he video footage was released in response to
requests under the state’s Open Public Records Act and common law.

At about the 3½-minute mark in the video, authorities say, Mielentz raises the gun and points it at
the officers. An officer crouched behind a trash basket can be seen firing his M4 rifle at Mielentz.

Mielentz was a self-described “loner” who suffered from hallucinations, anxiety and depression
after a stint in the Army, according to information found in public records.
