State authorities have identified the man killed by police after an armed standoff at a Panera Bread
restaurant in Princeton on T uesday.

Scott M ielentz
Scott Mielentz , 56, was shot to death after police negotiators spent several hours trying without
success to convince him to “surrender peacefully,” according to a statement from the Attorney
General’s Office.

No one else was injured in the confrontation, said the office.

Mielentz, who formerly lived in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and recently resided in Lawrenceville, was
pronounced dead at the scene.

T he standoff began around 10 a.m. T uesday, when police were seen crouched with their guns
drawn behind vehicles on Nassau Street, a block from Princeton University’s Nassau Hall.

T he university evacuated Henry House and Scheide Caldwell House, the two campus buildings
closest to the restaurant. In a statement T uesday, the Ivy League school noted that students were
on spring break.

Nassau Street was closed between Washington and Witherspoon streets as nearby businesses
were evacuated.

Customers and employees were able to escape the building, authorities said, but Mielentz
remained inside. He was shot and killed by police shortly before 3 p.m., according to the Attorney
General’s Office.

T he incident is being investigated by the attorney general’s Shooting Response T eam, which
oversees police shooting investigations and, in most cases, presents the evidence to a grand jury
for review.

Authorities declined to identify the officers involved.
