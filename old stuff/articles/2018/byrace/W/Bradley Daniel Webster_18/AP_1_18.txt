Daniel Webster's home days before Webster's May 11 gunfight with troopers. T he informant
said Webster had an AK-47 assault rifle and Uzi pistol.

A search warrant affidavit reveals 52-year-old Webster told the informant he had the weapons
"because he was not going back to jail and was ready to go on a shooting spree at City Hall."

that Webster was a felon barred from owning guns.

Four troopers were hurt and an ensuing fire consumed several buildings in downtown T alihina.
