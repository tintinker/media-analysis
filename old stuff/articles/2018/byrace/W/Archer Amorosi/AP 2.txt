CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) — T he father of a Minnesota teenager fatally shot by police is not
surprised the two officers involved won't be charged.

Carver County Attorney Mark Metz announced Thursday that the officers who killed 16-year-old
Archer Amorosi
Archer Amorosi in Chanhassen in July had no choice because he was charging at them with a
hatchet and a BB gun.

Don Amorosi tells KARE-T V that while the prosecutor's decision was expected, he was surprised
that Metz didn't share the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension's investigative report.

Amorosi says he can't understand why repeated calls to a crisis center and an earlier visit by
sheriff's deputies didn't prevent the confrontation that ended with his son's death.

Amorosi says his lawyers are considering whether to file a civil lawsuit.

Chanhassen is 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis.
