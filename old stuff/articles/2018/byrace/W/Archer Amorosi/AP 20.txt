CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) — Police were called to the Chanhassen home where a teenager was
fatally shot by deputies a total of nine times in the last three years.

T he last call — a mental health call — was made Friday. Authorities say Archer Amorosi
called 911 to say her son was suicidal and threatening her with knives and a baseball bat.
Investigators say the 16-year-old ran out of the house with a hatchet and what appeared to be a

Deputies used a stun gun on Amorosi before two Carver County deputies fired their guns. Amorosi
died. A hatchet and BB gun were found nearby.

including two domestic calls and one call for a juvenile female runaway. Details about each call
weren't available.
