according to law-enforcement sources. 

Susan Muller called police to report a burglary in progress, led officers into the home on 69th Street near 52nd

Road in Maspeth at around 6 p.m., and then pulled a knife on them, the sources said. 

"The 54-year old woman came at the officers with a knife and lunged at them," NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermont

Shea said. 

"One of the officers gave direction to put the knife down. We know this because there was body-camera video. 

"Subsequently, one officer discharges his service weapon three times, striking the female in the torso." 

Muller lived with her boyfriend, a retired NYPD sergeant, neighbors said. 

"Easygoing," one neighbor said of the boyfriend, "you couldn't get into an argument with him if you tried."
