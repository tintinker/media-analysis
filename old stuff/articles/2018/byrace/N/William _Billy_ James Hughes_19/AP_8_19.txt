ST . PAUL, Minn. (AP) — T he Latest on the fatal shooting of a man by St. Paul police officers (all
times local):

Personnel files for two St. Paul police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a man on Sunday
show mostly clean records plus words of praise.

Officer Vincent Adams was reprimanded in 2014 for a preventable squad car accident. But he got a
medal of commendation last year, partly for an incident that began with a car chase that officers
broke off for safety. Adams and his partner tracked the suspect down a few weeks later. While
Adams got hurt in the scuffle, he contributed to the success of a crime reduction project while on
light duty.

Officer Matthew Jones has no disciplinary actions in his file, but several thank-you notes, including
one in 2013 from a mental health official praising him for his skills in de-escalating a psychotic man.
