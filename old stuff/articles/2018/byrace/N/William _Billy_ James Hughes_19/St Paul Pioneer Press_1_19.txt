T he Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has turned its investigation into the fatal shooting
of William James Hug hes
William James Hug hes  by St. Paul police officers over to the Ramsey County attorney's office,
the state agency said Wednesday.

T he Ramsey County attorney's office has "been reviewing the evidence as it has been gathered
since this investigation began," spokesman Dennis Gerhardstein said Wednesday. "We are
committed to being thorough and diligent in our review and hope to have a decision made in the
coming weeks."

T he BCA began its investigation when Hughes was killed Aug. 5 in the Summit-University
neighborhood.

St. Paul Police Chief T odd Axtell released body camera footage of the incident on Aug. 17, saying
two officers open fire after Hughes, 43, raised a gun "in a sweeping fashion over the officers."

T he confrontation with Hughes began after a 911 caller reported on Aug. 5 at 2:34 a.m.: "Multiple
gun shots. 905 St. Anthony (Ave.) on the second floor" and then hung up, according to a transcript
of the call released by police on Friday.

T he first officers to arrive, Vince Adams and Matt Jones, entered an enclosed porch, Axtell said.
Adams knocked on an apartment door and a man could be heard saying, "I will kill you" and then
Hughes opened the door, Axtell has said.

Ramsey County Attorney John Choi previously said his office will analyze all the evidence gathered
by the BCA to decide whether the officers' use of lethal force was justified under the law.

Choi requested prosecutors conduct their review simultaneously with the BCA's investigation and
the BCA agreed to present his office with evidence as they collected it.
