money for a headstone and burial plot. 

“I would like a proper headstone so the world can know he existed and remember him,” Libby Meyers wrote

Monday on a donation website at gofundme.com/bill-hughes-memorial. 

Meyers said last week that she is waiting for answers about what happened to Hughes, 43, until she can see

officers’ body camera footage and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension does its investigation. 

St. Paul police officers responded to a 911 call of multiple shots fired on the upper floor of a multi-unit dwelling at

905 St. Anthony Ave. on Aug. 5 at 2:30 a.m., the BCA has said. 

After Hughes came out of an apartment door, two officers shot him.
