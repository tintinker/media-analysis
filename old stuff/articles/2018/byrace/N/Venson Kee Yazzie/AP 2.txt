CHINLE, Ariz. (AP) — T he FBI says an Arizona man was armed with a knife when he was fatally
shot by a National Park Service ranger at a national monument.

Authorities say 43-year-old Venson Yazzie
Chelly in Chinle.

Venson Yazzie was killed in an area overlooking ruins at Canyon de

It's still unclear what led to the shooting Friday afternoon.

T he FBI said Wednesday it is investigating an assault on a federal officer but won't elaborate.

Park Service spokeswoman Vanessa Lacayo says the ranger is on paid administrative leave and
won't be identified unless he's found guilty of a crime.

A local tour guide, Adam T eller, says Yazzie was a vendor who sold rock art to tourists at the
monument.

Canyon de Chelly, on the Navajo Nation, has thousands of ruins, carvings and paintings on stone.
