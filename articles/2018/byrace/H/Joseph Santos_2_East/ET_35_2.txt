South Whitehall Township no longer employs the police officer accused of fatally shooting a New
Jersey man in July near Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Police Chief Glen Dorney said Friday.

Beyond confirming that Jonathan R. Roselle is out of a job, Dorney declined to offer any further
comment.

Roselle, 33, of Parryville in Carbon County, is charged with voluntary manslaughter in the July 28
death of 44-year-old Joseph Santos

Joseph Santos , of Hasbrouck Heights.

Roselle is free on $75,000 unsecured bail with a preliminary hearing scheduled Sept. 20.

Roselle is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and at the time of the shooting was a
major in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.

He graduated from the Allentown Police Academy in December, then had 13 weeks of training, and
was on patrol by himself for less than five months.

T he evening of July 28, Santos left his fiancée and her son at the park and ended up on nearby
Hamilton Boulevard.

T here, he was acting erratically, drawing police.

Once Roselle arrived, Santos allegedly banged on the officer’s driver’s side window, jumped on the
hood of the police SUV and banged on the windshield.

Santos, unarmed, allegedly ignored Roselle’s orders to get on the ground and was walking toward
the officer, who opened fire, hitting Santos five times, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin
said in announcing Roselle’s arrest Aug. 7.
