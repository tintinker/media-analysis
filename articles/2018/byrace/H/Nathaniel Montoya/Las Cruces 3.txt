LAS CRUCES - T he Las Cruces police officer who fatally shot a homicide suspect over the weekend
"felt in fear of his life" before firing at least a dozen gunshots at the suspect who had been armed
with a modified firearm, police revealed Wednesday.

T he discovery of the firearm and the fact that no clear video of the shooting exists were among
new details of the incident that were released Wednesday by Las Cruces police Chief Patrick
Gallagher during a news conference.

Gallagher said the shooting investigation is still "in its early stages" and described it as a complex
undertaking because of its ties to the Feb. 16 shooting death of 29-year-old Abraham Gomez.

Gallagher said investigators have determined that Montoya and Gomez were involved in a physical
altercation outside an apartment in the 2300 block of Sambrano Avenue. Police were dispatched to
the scene around 7:30 p.m. after receiving reports of two men fighting, including one suspect who
was described by a 911 caller as "schizo," he said.

"Apparently, these two men were friends, and one of the men was having a dispute with the other
one," Gallagher said, adding that Gomez's body was found unconscious and unresponsive when
police arrived on the scene.

One witness told police that he heard one of the men yell, "No please! What are you doing?"
followed by a gunshot, according to a criminal complaint.

Gomez had one "small-caliber" gunshot wound to his back, Gallagher said, and died at
MountainView Regional Medical Center.

Gallagher said investigators quickly identified the shooting suspect as Montoya, who had
reportedly fled the shooting scene in a Dodge Durango.

"Less than hour later, his vehicle was found on (U.S.) Highway 70 with nobody in it," he said. "A
witness indicated that they saw Mr. Montoya get into a dark-colored minivan and leave the scene."

Gallagher said the minivan had been left on the side off the highway on Friday night because of
"vehicle problems," and that the owner tried to retrieve the vehicle the next day but was unable to
locate it and subsequently filed a stolen vehicle report by noon Saturday.

Around 5 p.m., a police officer spotted Montoya driving the stolen minivan along Galina Drive and
initiated a traffic stop. According to police, the minivan briefly stopped but then fled from the
officer, prompting a high-speed chase that reached speeds up to 60 mph.

Gallagher said Montoya led officers on the chase for about 10 minutes and, at one point, drove the
wrong way on Lohman Avenue before coming to a "halt" around 5:19 p.m. at the Valero's Corner
Store, 1401 E. Lohman Ave.

As Montoya drove into the gas station, he struck another vehicle, which then hit a 33-year-old male
pedestrian who sustained non-life-threatening injuries, Gallagher said.

"At that point, one of our officers approached the vehicle, still occupied by Mr. Montoya. T he
officer fearing for his safety fired his weapon at Mr. Montoya," who died at the scene.

Gallagher said the investigation has revealed that the officer, a seven-year veteran of the Las
Cruces Police Department, fired at least 12 shots at Montoya. Police also said Montoya had not
obeyed commands from the officer to show his hands.

A bystander recording the incident on their phone captured 12 gunshots in quick succession,
followed by another gunshot seconds later.

During a search of the minivan, investigators found a .22-caliber, "magazine-fed" rifle, containing
one round, in the front seat of the vehicle, Gallagher said. Police said the rifle had been modified to
resemble a shotgun.

Gallagher said investigators have not yet been able to determine if Montoya brandished the gun at
the officer. And, it is not known if the recovered gun was used in the shooting that killed Gomez.
Both remain under investigation.

But, Gallagher said, "I know enough at this point that the officer felt in fear of his life."

He also said that the officer – whose name has not been publicly revealed – was not wearing his
body camera during the incident, something that is being investigated internally.

"It's our understanding that (the officer) had responded the night before and was aware of the
situation and was doing investigative work on the homicide," Gallagher said, "and came into work
the next day and never had the chance to retrieve his body camera from the docking station
because we were so busy."

Gallagher also said that at least one surveillance camera at the gas station wasn't working at the
time of the shooting.

"One of (the cameras) that would have provided a very good view of the shooting incident was,
unfortunately, not functioning," he said, adding that footage from two other cameras only show
officers converging on the gas station.

T he shooting is being investigated by the Officer-Involved Incident T ask Force, which includes
investigators from the Las Cruces Police Department, New Mexico State Police, New Mexico State
University Police and the DoÃ±a Ana County Sheriff's Office.
