T en years ago, 26-year-old Santiag o Calderon
police officer Ramon Lopez.

Santiag o Calderon Jr. stood on Gates Street with his back to Aurora

Calderon, who lived steps away on Ashland Avenue, raised a gun in his right hand and fired several
shots toward Phillips Park, according to a police report Lopez filed after the April 4, 2008,
confrontation. Lopez ordered Calderon to drop his gun, and Calderon appeared to ditch it in a
parked car. T hen Lopez told him to get on the ground.

"Shoot me," Calderon said, according to the 2008 report.

Calderon started to walk away, so Lopez ran and tackled him from behind. When another officer
arrived, Calderon was facedown on the sidewalk yelling or crying while handcuffed. He was
arrested and charged with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and reckless discharge of a
firearm.

A decade later, at age 36, Calderon died March 22 in a downtown Aurora shootout involving two
Aurora police officers. Kane County Coroner Rob Russell said Calderon's preliminary cause of death
was "multiple" gunshot wounds. Authorities have not yet disclosed how many or clarified whether
one or both of the officers, both investigators, fired their guns. T he Kane County Major Crimes
T ask Force is investigating. Aurora police have not yet released video of the incident.

"He's not a saint," said Calderon's mother, Elba Solis. "I don't know what happened that day. Do I
want to know? Yeah. Do I want to find out? Yeah. But ... All I know is that I got a call saying to come
down to the police station, and they told me my son was dead ... All I know is I got (his) four kids
and I've got to try to take care of them."

Solis described Calderon as happy-go-lucky and impulsive, close to his four siblings, with many
friends and few enemies. Maybe it was his time, she said. She said she's just trying to pick up the
pieces.

"If they felt they were doing their job, well, more power to them," Solis said. "T hey left four kids
fatherless. It's just that way. Nothing, nothing that I can say or nothing, nothing that anybody can
do can bring my son back."

Solis said she knows her son will always be watching down on his kids, because of how much he
loved them. He was a good father who would spoil them one second and discipline the next, she
said.

In her Yorkville apartment during a recent interview, Solis, 59, teared up reflecting on the son

whose last words to her were that he loved her, whose favorite saying was "Count your blessings,
not your problems." He never married and was effectively a single father, Solis said. Now she said
she's doing her best to get his four children, ages 12 to 17, through the rest of the school year.
Her two-bedroom apartment is too small for them all to keep living there, so she also has to think
about moving.

Solis said Calderon had been between jobs and was trying to go to school for truck driving. T hat
was his last wish, Solis said.

Calderon had a record of arrests on charges related to domestic violence, soliciting a sex act,
growing marijuana and trespassing at the Hollywood Casino. His convictions included reckless
discharge of a firearm, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, resisting police and producing
marijuana.

Calderon had more than a dozen encounters with Aurora police, according to reports provided to
the Beacon-News. In a few cases, he also was a victim of crime, reporting his car burglarized or
vandalized. Police listed him as a witness to a 2001 attempted murder in which a man was jumped,
punched, kicked and stabbed.

Solis said that at some point during her son's adult life, some people started to wonder about his
mental health. In one police report, a passenger in Calderon's car told an officer that Calderon had
bipolar disorder but did not take medication. But Solis said that to her knowledge, he was never
diagnosed.

Days before his death, Aurora police questioned Calderon following a shooting on the city's west
side. On March 18, police were searching for a silver or white SUV they suspected was involved in
the shooting. Investigators focused on a driveway with two SUVs, a silver model and a white Ford
Escape.

When the Ford left the driveway and headed north on South Lake Street, police followed and
clocked it going about 7 mph over the speed limit.

T hey pulled it over on the 100 block of South Lincolnway Street, according to reports. Calderon was
driving. His two passengers said they were going to a party in North Aurora, while Calderon told
police they were headed to an East Side Aurora barbecue, according to reports. T heir stories didn't
match up.

A pat-down search followed, and police reported feeling a large, metallic object in Calderon's jacket
pocket. An officer handcuffed Calderon, then unzipped his jacket, according to reports. Officers
found a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun with no rounds in the chamber but seven live rounds in the
magazine, police reported. Calderon told police he had more ammunition. Police found the box
under the driver's seat.

Calderon said there was no way his gun could have been used in the shooting earlier in the day,
according to police reports. And police ultimately did not believe Calderon or anyone in his car was
involved in the shooting earlier that day, the reports said.

But, as a convicted felon without a firearm owner's identification card, he wasn't supposed to have
a gun. He was charged with felonies including aggravated unlawful use of a loaded weapon and
appeared in Aurora Branch Court where Associate Judge Sandra Parga set his bail at $75,000.
Calderon bonded out, then skipped a status hearing March 21 in St. Charles. Kane County
Associate Judge David Kliment ordered a warrant issued for his arrest.

T he next day - March 22 - police said two investigators in an unmarked car followed an SUV driven
by Calderon from a "known gang house" on South Lake Street to the first block of East Galena
Boulevard, where they stopped it.

Calderon, who had a 24-year-old Aurora man in the car with him, shot at officers, then drove away
eastbound, striking another car at Galena and Route 25, Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said.

After the crash, Calderon ran, exchanging gunfire with the investigators, police said. Calderon was
fatally shot in the parking lot on South LaSalle Street between Galena and Downer Place, police
said.

Other officers started to arrive. One reported seeing Calderon on the ground near a concrete pillar
under the railroad bridge. Calderon did not respond to police and was motionless, according to
reports.

When one sergeant got there, he reported seeing Calderon still facedown, restrained with two sets
of handcuffs.

"It appeared he was bleeding from his head," the sergeant wrote. "T he medics asked for an officer
to un-handcuff the offender."

Police removed the handcuffs, and medics turned Calderon over so he was facing up, according to
reports. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Officers reported finding a pistol on the sidewalk a few feet away.

Ziman said the investigators involved, Matthew Huber and Colin Griffin, were both put on paid
administrative leave while the case is under investigation. Police have not disclosed why they
stopped the car.

Medics treated Griffin for a graze wound and Huber for shoulder injuries. Both were taken to an
Aurora hospital, treated and released, according to reports.

T he next afternoon, two men, including one who said he was Calderon's brother, pulled up to the
parking lot in a silver sedan. T hey parked on LaSalle street, got out and tried to retrace some of
Calderon's last steps.

"I don't understand," one of the men said as he walked through the parking lot, under the
overpass.

T wo weeks later, friends and family filled Healy Chapel on Downer Place for a visitation. Calderon

wore a pinstriped Cubs jersey, because, Solis said, that's what his kids wanted.

T wo toy owls perched near his head, and a Cubs hat rested near his left side. One day, well into
Calderon's adulthood, "he just came up with this fascination of owls and it never stopped," Solis
said. He thought they were good luck, she said. A family photograph and a cross were also tucked
inside the casket.

T he family is thankful for everyone who has chipped in financially or supported them with hugs,
prayers and kind words, Solis said.

Solis said when Calderon would visit, sometimes he'd leave her money, $10 or $20. He often
brought her groceries or tacos.

He believed in God, in his own way, and was philosophical, Solis said. He liked to have answers, and
he liked to be right. He'd challenge anyone on anything, she said.

But she remembers him as a good kid who played basketball, football and baseball and didn't get
into fights. At family gatherings, Calderon was always the clown, Solis said.

Earlier this year, when Solis was in the hospital, Calderon showed up with a balloon and teddy bear,
his mother said.

"He goes, 'Mom, I got the receipt in the car, I'm coming back for this stuff tomorrow, I just didn't
want to come in empty-handed,' " Solis said. "And the nurse is like, 'You didn't just say that?' "

Solis knew he was only kidding. She knew her son better than that, she said.

Yet he didn't want to worry her and didn't tell her much when he got arrested, she said. T here were
things he liked to keep to himself.

"When he shared, he shared, and when he didn't, he didn't," Solis said.

T he night he died, he was just visiting someone, she said.

"It was the second time they followed him out of there in an unmarked car," Solis said. "An
unmarked car, anybody would be scared."

T hough acknowledging he'd been to jail, Solis said she believes her son was "not a gangbanger"
but was lumped in because of people he hung around with.

"Like they say, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink, so that's the way he
was," Solis said. "He had friends all over. I didn't know how many friends he had until he died."
