Aurora police have released video clips and still photos that show the March 22 fatal shootout
between two officers and 36-year-old Santiag o Calderon

Santiag o Calderon of Aurora.

Spokesman Dan Ferrelli said police released the video "to be as transparent as possible during an
open and complicated investigation."

"Community trust results from that transparency and our image to the people we serve and
protect is paramount in our every day operations," Ferrelli said.

Police said two special operations investigators followed a green SUV they’d spotted leaving a
suspected gang house on the 200 block of East Galena Boulevard and tried to pull it over around
9:45 p.m. March 22.

Police said Calderon, who was driving the vehicle, fired at them, wounding one officer in the leg. He
then drove away before crashing at the intersection of Galena Boulevard and Broadway where he
tried to run away and exchanged gunfire with the officers.

Calderon was struck and killed in a parking lot on LaSalle Street between Galena and Downer Place.
When the officers went to render medical aid, they found a gun at Calderon’s side. He was
pronounced dead at the scene.

One of the investigators, Colin Griffin, suffered a gunshot wound to a leg while the other
investigator, Matt Huber, suffered a shoulder injury when he was taking cover. Both were treated
and released from an Aurora hospital.

Huber and Griffin have been placed on paid administrative leave while the Kane County Major
Crimes T ask Force investigates.
