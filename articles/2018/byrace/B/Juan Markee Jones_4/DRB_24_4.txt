Danville Police Chief Scott Booth has released a statement regarding the fatal officer-involved
shooting from early Sunday.

"No Police officer wants to use deadly force nor do they want to use any form of force that could
result in serious injury," Booth said Monday. "When death or serious injury happens, we deeply
regret the loss of life or injury and we feel compassion for them, their family and their friends."

Juan Markee Jones
Juan Markee Jones , 25, of Danville died shortly after officers report responding to a domestic
assault complaint in a parking lot of the 2300 block of North Main Street. Officers say the suspect
led them to a wooded area on Sunset Drive.

It was there, police report, that Jones "suddenly turned on the officers in a threatening manner."

Booth also urged the community not to rush to judgement or listen to rumors concerning the
shooting on Sunset Drive, though he did not specify what those rumors are.
