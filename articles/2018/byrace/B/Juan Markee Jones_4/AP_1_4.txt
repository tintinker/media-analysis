 
DANVILLE, Va. (AP) - Virginia State Police are investigating the fatal weekend shooting of a 25-year-old man by

Danville officers.  

State police said in a statement Monday that the man who was shot has been identified as Juan Markee Jones.  

Danville police previously said the shooting followed a domestic disturbance call Sunday. According to a news

release , officers encountered a man suspected of attacking a woman.  

Police say the man ignored commands and drove into a nearby wooded area. Confronted again there, he exited the

vehicle but refused to show his hands.  

The news release says a Taser was deployed without success. The man then turned on the officers in a

"threatening" manner, and officers fired at him.  

No officers were injured.  

State police will turn over their findings to a prosecutor for review.
