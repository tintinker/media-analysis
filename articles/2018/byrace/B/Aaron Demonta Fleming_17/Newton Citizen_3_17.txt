COVINGT ON â€” T he Covington Police officer who was shot in the head Monday while pursuing a
shoplifting suspect had surgery Wednesday to relieve swelling and pressure on his brain.

An update on Officer Matt Cooper on the Covington Police Facebook page stated that the surgery
was a "proactive/precautionary measure," adding, "T he surgery went very well."

T he surgery was performed at Grady Memorial Hospital where Cooper was transferred T uesday
after he was initially transported by air ambulance to Atlanta Medical Center. Doctors have not yet
performed a surgery to remove the bullet, which is lodged next to Cooper's carotid artery.

Cooper, 34, was wounded shortly after noon on Monday after he and another officer were called
to the Walmart on Industrial Boulevard in response to a shoplifting incident.

T wo juvenile suspects were apprehended in the parking lot of the store, but a third, 21-year-old
Aaron Demonta Fleming
Aaron Demonta Fleming  of Conyers, fled across the street behind a shopping center. Cooper
and another officer pursued him, and Cooper was shot once in the head.

Fleming's body was found a short time later in nearby woods, dead of an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound. Fleming was on probation and there was a warrant out for his arrest for probation
violation.

A fundraiser for Cooper and his family is planned for tonight, starting at 5 p.m., on the Square in
Covington. In addition, proceeds from Saturday's annual Covington Police Fuzz Run will be
dedicated to him. T he Police Department is asking that anyone attending the 35th annual road
race wear blue to show their support for Cooper.
