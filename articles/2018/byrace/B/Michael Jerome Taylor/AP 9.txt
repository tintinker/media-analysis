parking lot, driving at one of our officers."

A few officers fired at Michael Jerome T aylor
before crashing into another parked car, pushing it through the wall of a bicycle shop.

M ichael Jerome Taylor and the vehicle hit parked cars and a light pole

T he officers weren't injured, and are on administrative leave.
