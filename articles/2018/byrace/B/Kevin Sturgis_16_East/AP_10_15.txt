HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Authorities say a deputy U.S. marshal shot and killed while serving a
warrant in Pennsylvania was struck by a bullet fired through a wall by a fellow officer and not by a
gunman who opened fire on police.

Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Thursday that conclusion was made after
laboratory tests were performed on material related to the Jan. 18 death of Deputy Marshal
Christopher Hill.

Chardo says 31-year-old Kevin Sturg is
him to death outside the home in Harrisburg.

Kevin Sturg is  fired the first shot and that police were justified in shooting

At the time, T he Associated Press and other news outlets reported it was a bullet fired by Sturgis
that killed the 45-year-old Hill. T he U.S. Marshals Service says ballistics and forensics contradict
those initial indications.
