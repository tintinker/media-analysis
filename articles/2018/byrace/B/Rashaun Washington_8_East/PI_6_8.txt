as 37-year-old Rashaun Washington. 

Officers with the Vineland Police Department encountered Washington on the front porch of a house on West

Wood Street at about 11:30 a.m. Saturday. Police had responded to the location after a caller reported that a man

was acting "suspiciously," according to the Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office. 

"An encounter between the officers and the subject lasted for several minutes" before the man was shot,

Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae said in a statement. It was not clear whether Washington, of Bridgeton, was

armed or what took place during that encounter. 

The death is being investigated by the Prosecutor's Office, in accordance with state guidelines that pertain to

police-involved shootings, the statement said.
