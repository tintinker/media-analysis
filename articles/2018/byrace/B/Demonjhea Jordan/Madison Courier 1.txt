LOUISVILLE - T he family of a man shot more than 20 times by police is suing officers, accusing
them of excessive force. T he Courier Journal reports 21-year-old Demonjhea Jordan
Demonjhea Jordan was killed in
April while fleeing a robbery. Jordan's parents say Officers Joshua Weyer, Benjamin Dean and Kody
Despain and Detective Joseph Fox used "unauthorized and unnecessary deadly force." Body
camera recordings show one officer shooting at Jordan from a half-block away, screaming "shots
fired" as they run down a sidewalk. Another begins shooting through the windshield of his cruiser. A
third shoots from the side. Lt. Aaron Crowell said "multiple sources" said Jordan shot at officers,
and the video shows the gun. Officers can "use force, in this case deadly force, to protect
themselves and others from death or serious physical injury," Police Chief Steve Conrad said in
April. Police and prosecutors declined the newspaper's request to comment on the lawsuit. Weyer,
Dean, Despain and Fox remain on administrative reassignment as the investigastion continues.
