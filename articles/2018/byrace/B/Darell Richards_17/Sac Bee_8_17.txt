"Darell, I miss you already," Christine Vang cried. "How am I supposed to live the rest of my life
without you, Darell?"

She was gathered with a group of people to mourn the life of Darell Richards
man who was shot and killed by Sacramento police SWAT  officers Thursday morning after
brandishing a pellet gun that looked like a 9 mm handgun and knife. Vang is Richards' mother.

T he vigil, held Friday night at 21st Street and 2nd Avenue in Curtis Park, was organized by
Sacramento Black Lives Matter.

A large crowd quietly held hands and joined together for a prayer, led in order to "pray for justice
for Darell, we pray for justice for the family, and for unity amongst us as a community," a group
leader said.

"It is our duty to fight for our freedom, it is our duty to win, we must love and support one another,
we have nothing to lose but our chains," the crowd chanted after the prayer.

Vang and Richards' other family members cried together while crowd members came and hugged
them.

Chucc Gauthier said he came to the vigil to support his best friend, Richards' father.

"T here's really no words for it, it just shouldn't have happened," Gauthier said. "He loved to ride
bikes, he was always out and about. He was full of energy. I can't even talk, I can't even talk. He
was a good kid."

"All I can say on behalf of the family is that we are saddened by this tragedy," Richards' public
defender Quoc T o said. "Darell was a kind soul, a good young man. Regardless of the
circumstances or the situation, this was a life that was cut short tragically and it did not need to
happen."

"We can't forget his face," Vang said quietly to a member of the crowd.
