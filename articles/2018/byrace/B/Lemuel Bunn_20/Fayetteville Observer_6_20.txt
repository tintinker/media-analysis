Fayetteville police said they had no updates Wednesday on the condition of a pregnant woman
stabbed at an apartment off Raeford Road.

Stephanie Williams, 34, was listed in stable condition after the attack Tuesday at Treetop Garden
Apartments. Her attacker, 40-year-old Lemuel B unn
Lemuel Bunn of Roanoke Rapids, was shot by police and
later died.

On Wednesday, a nursing supervisor at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center said Williams was not on a
list of patients whose conditions the hospital can release.

Officer Asia Cannon, a spokeswoman for Fayetteville police, said she could not provide any updates
on the case.

Officers responding to a 911 call from Williams forced their way into the apartment and found her
bleeding. Bunn, holding her neck with a knife, refused orders from police, according to the
department. An officer then shot Bunn.

Cannon said she expects the officer's name will be released this week. T he officer is on
administrative duty as State Bureau of Investigation reviews the shooting.
