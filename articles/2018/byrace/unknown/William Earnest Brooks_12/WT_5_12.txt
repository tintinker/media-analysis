Deputies first responded to reports of a man driving an AT V in the yard on Social Circle Fairplay
Road around 2:25 p.m. T hursday. T he homeowner complained the man, later identified as Brooks,
was supposed to be cutting his lawn and wanted deputies to speak to him.

When deputies arrived, Brooks fled on foot and an altercation began.

"It appears the suspect was overpowering the deputy and the deputy fired one round," Nelly Miles
with the GBI said at a press conference Thursday evening in front of the sheriff's office. "T he
suspect took the weapon from the deputy and fled deeper into the woods."

Miles said helicopters observed Brooks flee to the Hard Labor Creek Reservoir and attempt to
steal a boat, but then waded back into the water as other officers arrived.

"He brandished the weapon and officers fired," Miles said.

In all, six deputies and one officer with the SCPD all fired at Brooks, who was killed at the scene.

T he GBI took over the scene when they arrived and spoke with the deputies and officers involved.
After they conclude their investigation, they will hand any findings to the District Attorney's office,
while the WCSO will resume control of the case.

Sheriff Joe Chapman said he was confident in the GBI's handling of the case.

"I hate that this incident happened," Chapman said. "But that's why we rely on these people at the
GBI."
