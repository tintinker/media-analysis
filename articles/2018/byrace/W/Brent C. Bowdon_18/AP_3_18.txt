Havasu City police last month was unarmed although he told officers he had a gun.

Kingman police are investigating the July 25 death of 56-year-old B rent B owdon

Police say Bowdon ignored repeated commands to show officers his hands and drop any
weapons, and kept his right hand behind his back.

Investigators say Bowdon appeared to be intoxicated and walked to within about 15 feet of police.

Fearing that Bowdon was armed, three officers fired 10 rounds.

Investigators say Bowdon was hit several times and was declared dead at the scene, but didn't
have a gun.

Police had responded to the Lake Havasu City home after getting a 911 call from Bowdon and
hearing him argue loudly with his wife.
