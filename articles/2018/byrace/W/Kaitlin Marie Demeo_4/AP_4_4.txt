COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Police in Ohio's capital city say an armed woman killed during a SWAT
standoff was shot when two longtime Columbus officers returned fire.

Kaitlin Marie Demeo  was shot when she fired at officers from
Columbus police say 25-year-old Kaitlin Marie Demeo
the window of a home on Saturday morning, several hours after the standoff began. It is the city's
fourth police-involved shooting this year.

Police say a report of gunfire prompted the initial response to the home where Demeo barricaded
herself, armed with a rifle. Police say negotiators tried unsuccessfully to persuade her to surrender.

On Monday, police identified the SWAT  officers involved as a 29-year veteran of the department
and a 22-year veteran officer.

An official from the local police union didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
