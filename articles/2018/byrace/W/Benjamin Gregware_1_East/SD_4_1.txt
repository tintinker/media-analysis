 
State Trooper Chris Brown and Richmond Police Officer Richard Greenough pulled over a man on Interstate 89

Sunday afternoon after his ex-wife reported that he was distraught. Motorist Benjamin Gregware got out of his car

and held a 9mm pistol to his head, then walked toward the officers and ignored orders to stop. 

The cops fired 12 rounds and struck Gregware three times, killing him. 

It was the third fatal state police shooting in six months and the fourth shooting inivolving Trooper Brown. Less

than a month earlier, on January 16, Brown was one of nine cops who opened up on Nathan Giffin, 32, on the

grounds of Montpelier High School. Giffin had robbed a credit union nearby with what turned out to be a BB gun. 

Michael Battles had a similar faux firearm when Brown and four fellow troopers shot him in Poultney on September

1, 2017. 

A trooper since 2012, Brown also shot a man in the leg in Fayston during a standoff in 2015. 

State Police Col. Matt Birmingham said Monday that he was contracting with a consultant to review the

department's policies. "Certainly, there is great cause for concern when you have multiple officer-involved

shootings in a short period of time," he said. 

Birmingham said Brown will be on paid leave while authorities investigate the latest case. 

Police said Gregware's ex-wife reported that she was worried about him. He had appeared intoxicated when he

visited his children that day. She said he had recently lost his job. After the visit, he let her know he'd headed to

Walmart to buy ammo. 

A trooper called him, and Gregware, 42, reported that he had a handgun and was driving south on I-89 - and that he

planned to kill himself when he ran out of gas. Before he did, Greenough and Brown pulled him over in Bolton.
