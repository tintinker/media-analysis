CHASKA, Minn. (AP) — Personnel records show a sheriff's deputy involved in the fatal shooting of
a suicidal Minnesota teenager has been disciplined four times, but has also received seven
performance awards.

Documents released Wednesday don't detail what led to the three suspensions and one written
reprimand against Carver County Cpl. Jacob Hodge. But they list unpaid suspensions of 40 hours in
2010 and 84 hours in 2011.

Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud on Thursday declined to elaborate.

Investigators say 16-year-old Archer Amorosi
and a BB pistol. After a stun gun failed to stop him, Hodge and another deputy opened fire.

Archer Amorosi ran from his house last Friday holding a hatchet

Hodge's awards include three for actions involving suicidal or mentally ill individuals. T he other
deputies involved have won awards but had no disciplinary actions.
