Body camera footage of an officer-involved shooting from earlier this month may soon be made
available to the public.

T he Monroe County Sheriff's Office announced Friday its intent to release footage from the Aug. 7
incident, during which deputies shot 24-year-old Daniel B oyer
Daniel Boyer of Bloomington. According to
police, Boyer pointed a loaded handgun at deputies Don T eague and Deandre Moxley as they
served arrest warrants at a mobile home in southwestern Monroe County.

In response, the two deputies fired their guns, striking Boyer four times. Boyer later died of his
injuries.

was no further action needed, Sheriff Brad Swain is offering Boyer's family the chance to review
the footage.

T he news release states that footage will be distributed to media after the private viewing takes
place.
