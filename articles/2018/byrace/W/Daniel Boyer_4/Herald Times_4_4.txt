Monroe County Coroner Joani Shields released the cause and manner of death for Boyer by email

According to Shields, the bullet that killed Boyer entered through the front of his left thigh, traveled

the abdomen and chest with preliminary manner as homicide," she said.

A second bullet that struck the same thigh exited from the lower left side of Boyer's back. A third
shot entered the right index finger at the second knuckle and the bullet became lodged in his wrist.

And, a fourth gunshot wound was to the left side of Boyer's back. T he coroner described this injury
as a superficial wound with the bullet exiting four inches from where it entered.

"T o be clear, there is no way of knowing which gunshot wound happened first," Shields said.

T ower Road, off Ison Road, to serve arrest warrants. T he deputies had information that Boyer,
who was wanted on methamphetamine charges, was also at the mobile home Tuesday morning.

rookie deputy, on T uesday.

Both deputies were wearing body cameras at the time of the police-action shooting. Capt. Ryan
