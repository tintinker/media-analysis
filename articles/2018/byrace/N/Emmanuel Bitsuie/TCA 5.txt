 
July 06--The two men killed Wednesday in a stabbing and subsequent shooting involving a Pueblo police officer

have been identified by Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter as David Bitsuie and Emmanuel Bitsuie. 

David Bitsuie, 52, was the uncle of Emmanuel Bitsuie, 32. 

The Pueblo Police Department was called to the 1200 block of East Abriendo just after 3:45 p.m. Wednesday on a

report of a family disturbance, but while they were en route, the call was changed to a stabbing. 

According to police, the first officer to arrive on scene encountered Emmanuel Bitsuie, who apparently had stabbed

his uncle. The officer used lethal force, shooting Emmanuel Bitsuie, who died at the scene. 

David Bitsuie was alive when officers arrived at the residence. He was transported to a local hospital, but later died

as a result of his injuries. 

The officer involved in the shooting was treated for a minor injury and was released at the hospital. 

Further details about the incident were not made available Thursday and the investigation is ongoing. 

The shooting is being investigated by the Tenth Judicial Critical Incident Team during which time the involved

officer will be on routine paid administrative leave, per police protocol.
