SALT  LAKE CIT Y (AP) — Police say officers shot and killed a Salt Lake City man after authorities
were called to a domestic violence situation.

T he Deseret News reports 32-year-old Delorean Pikyavit
following the shooting outside a Salt Lake City home.

Delorean Pikyavit  died from his injuries Wednesday

Police Sgt. Brandon Shearer says officers approached Pikyavit, and he ran back into the house.

Shearer says a SWAT  team and negotiators were called as officers did not know if a hostage was
inside. Pikyavit exited the house and approached officers about an hour later.

Shearer says Pikyavit's "actions caused the officers to respond, at which time the suspect was
shot."

Police did not say what those actions were and if he was armed.

West Valley police are investigating the shooting.
