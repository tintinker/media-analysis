OWASSO, Okla. (AP) — An Oklahoma prosecutor says police officers in a Tulsa suburb were
justified when they fatally shot a man who authorities say threatened them with an AK-47 assault
rifle.

Authorities say 39-year-old Duane Preciado
carried the rifle as he met Owasso Officers Casey Lawson and Laura Lehner while they responded
to requests for a welfare check. Authorities said Preciado was shot as he moved toward the
officers while making threatening comments.

Duane Preciado  was shot and killed March 21 in Owasso. Preciado

Matthew Ballard, district attorney for Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties, says in a report that
Preciado was a "depressed veteran" who yelled "Kill me!" before the officers shot him three times.

Ballard says officers tried to defuse the situation but "were compelled by Mr. Preciado's actions to
respond with deadly force."
