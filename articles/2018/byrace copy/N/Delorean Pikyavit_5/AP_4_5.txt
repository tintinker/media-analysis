SALT  LAKE CIT Y (AP) — Body camera footage released in an officer-involved shooting in Salt Lake
City shows the victim was armed with a knife and told police to shoot him before he was killed
during a standoff with a SWAT  team.

Salt Lake City police released the footage Wednesday of the April 18 shooting of 32-year-old
Delorean Pikyavit  on the porch of his girlfriend's home in Sugar House.

Pikyavit had a knife in one hand and a pair of broken scissors in the other when he ignored officers
repeated pleas to drop the weapons and finally shouted, "Shoot me."

Police say his girlfriend called officers to the scene on a report of domestic violence and they didn't
know if she was being held hostage in the house. She had gone to a neighbor's by then but police
say she had been assaulted.
