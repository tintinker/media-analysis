MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — A Montana jury has exonerated a Missoula police officer who shot and
killed an armed 49-year-old woman during a confrontation last year.

T he Missoulian reports that the jury needed little time Friday to find that the actions of Officer
Joseph Burger were justified.

T estimony and evidence presented to the seven-person jury at the coroner's inquest showed
Jenessa Cooper had swung into aggression when she first attacked her roommates.

Burger testified that he followed his training when he responded to the house last Nov. 18 and
shouted commands at Cooper to drop her .45-caliber handgun. He says he fired seven rounds at
her as she raised her pistol toward him.

Cooper died from a single gunshot wound to the head.
