LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) — Prosecutors have cleared a Las Cruces police officer of any wrongdoing
in the deadly shooting of a New Mexico man suspected of homicide.

Dona Ana County prosecutors determined last week that officer Joseph Campa's shooting of 23-
year-old Nathaniel M ontoya

N athaniel Montoya  in mid-February was justified under state law.

Montoya was accused of shooting and killing 29-year-old Abraham Gomez in Las Cruces. An
officer spotted Montoya in a car a day after the shooting.

Police entered into a pursuit, which ended at a Las Cruces gas station where Montoya crashed.
Police say Campa commanded Montoya to show his hands.

Police say Montoya raised a gun and Campa fired several shots. Montoya was pronounced dead at
the scene. Police say a rifle was recovered from the car.
