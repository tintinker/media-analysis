than 24 hours later, Montoya himself was dead, shot multiple times by at least one Las Cruces
police officer.

Montoya, 23, was shot following a vehicle pursuit through city streets that ended in the parking lot
of the Valero gas station, 1401 E. Lohman Ave.

A bystander recording the incident on their phone captured 12 gunshots in quick succession,
followed by another gunshot seconds later.

"At least one LCPD officer fired several rounds that struck the suspect," a Las Cruces Police
Department news release stated. Montoya was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Montoya was the primary suspect in homicide a day earlier. Witnesses told police that Montoya
and another man got into a "physical altercation" about 7:30 p.m. Friday in the 2300 block of
Sambrano Avenue.

When officers arrived at the scene of Friday's incident, they found a man unconscious in front of
the residence. Montoya had fled the scene in his personal vehicle, police said.

T he unconscious man, 29, was transported to a local hospital, but didn't survive. Police have not
released the man's name nor the nature of his injuries.

Police believe Montoya ditched his vehicle Friday night along the side of the roadway near Bataan
Memorial East and Riconada Boulevard and hopped in a dark-in-color van, driven by an unknown
person.

Police, following up on a tip, found a van matching that description in the Las Colinas neighborhood
about 5 p.m. Saturday.

Montoya was "positively identified" prior to a traffic stop, police said.

Police said Montoya, driving the van, fled the traffic stop and led police on a high-speed pursuit
throughout the city.

"LCPD officers attempted to PIT  (precision intervention technique) the vehicle but were
unsuccessful," according to a news release.

Montoya drove the van into the Valero parking lot and struck multiple vehicles, police said. One

vehicle was pushed into a pedestrian, police said. T he 33-year-old pedestrian was transported to a
local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Las Cruces police fired at Montoya after the van was stopped.

"T he officer's name will be withheld until the investigation is completed," the news release stated,
indicating it may have been only one officer who fired a weapon.

It's unclear whether Montoya was armed, but a news release sent Saturday morning saying police
were on the lookout for him stated, "N athaniel M ontoya

N athaniel Montoya  should be considered armed."

Police didn't offer any new information on Sunday. It's unclear whether any information will be
released Monday, Presidents Day, a holiday for most city personnel.

Las Cruces police and a multi-agency officer-involved incident task force are investigating. T he task
force includes New Mexico State Police, DoÃ±a Ana County Sheriff's Office, New Mexico State
University Police Department and the LCPD.
