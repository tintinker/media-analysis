JONESBOROUGH, T enn. (AP) — A Tennessee prosecutor says a police officer was justified in a
fatal shooting earlier this year in which a man charged at him with a large knife.

District Attorney General Ken Baldwin said in a letter Monday to the Tennessee Bureau of
Investigation that an investigation showed no inappropriate actions by Jonesborough Officer Chad
Reece. T he Johnson City Press reports that Reece shot 26-year-old M ark Clinton H arrell
Church Hill three times in March.

M ark Clinton Harrell Jr. of

Police had been dispatched to a motel on a report of suspicious activity involving another man,
who they found in a car. When officers approached the vehicle, Harrell exited with the knife.

Baldwin said Harrell was given multiple opportunities to drop the machete-like weapon and Reece
only fired when Harrell charged at him swinging the knife.
