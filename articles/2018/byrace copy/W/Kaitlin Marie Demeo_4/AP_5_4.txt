M arie Demeo , of Columbus. She was fatally shot around 8 a.m. Saturday during a standoff that
began several hours earlier.

Police spokesman Sgt. Dean Worthington says officers initially responded to a home after a report
of shots being fired. Worthington says Demeo had barricaded herself inside the home, armed with
a rifle.

Worthington says Columbus SWAT  and Negotiation Team officers tried to persuade Demeo to
surrender.

He says Demeo fired at officers from an upstairs window at around 8 a.m., prompting two SWAT
officers to kill her.

It's the fourth police shooting in Columbus this year.
