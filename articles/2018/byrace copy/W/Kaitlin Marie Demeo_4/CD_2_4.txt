T wo Columbus police SWAT  officers acted within the Police Division's use-of-firearms policy when
they returned fire and fatally shot a woman who was barricaded with a rifle inside a Southeast Side
house last March, police said.

Kaitlin Marie Demeo
Kaitlin Marie Demeo , 25, was shot at a residence in the 6300 block of Whims Road in a
neighborhood east of Brice Road and just north of Canal Winchester on March 24, 2018. Demeo
lived in South Linden and was visiting a relative at the time.

Demeo had barricaded herself inside the house during that Saturday afternoon and periodically had
fired an AR-15 rifle from the second-floor windows of the house. Attempts to negotiate with her by
phone that day were unsuccessful, Columbus police said.

When Demeo fired a rifle from a second-floor, rear window about 8 p.m., SWAT  Officers Keith Kise
and Glenn T hivener returned fire, shooting her, Columbus police said.

T he officers were authorized to use deadly force because Demeo was endangering the
neighborhood, police said.

Eight spent shell casings were found inside the house along with a second loaded magazine,
according to the Franklin County prosecutor's office.

T he Columbus Police Division's Firearms/Police Involved Death Review Board found that Kise and
T hivener had correctly followed division policy.

A Franklin County grand jury decided in November not to indict the officers.

Kise, 47, has been with the Police Division for more than 23 years. T hivener, 51, has more than 30
years of experience.
