PRINCET ON

State authorities have identified the man killed by police after an armed standoff at a Panera Bread
restaurant in Princeton on T uesday.

Scott M ielentz
Scott Mielentz , 56, was shot and killed after police negotiators spent several hours trying without
success to convince him to “surrender peacefully,” according to a statement from the Attorney
General’s Office.

Mielentz, who formerly lived in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and recently resided in Lawrenceville, was
pronounced dead at the scene.

T he tense standoff began around 10 a.m. T uesday, and police were seen crouched with their guns
drawn behind vehicles on Nassau Street, a block from Princeton University’s Nassau Hall.

Customers and employees escaped the building, authorities said, but Mielentz remained inside.

He was shot and killed by police shortly before 3 p.m., according to the Attorney General’s Office.

T he incident is being investigated by the attorney general’s Shooting Response T eam, which
oversees police shooting investigations and, in most cases, presents the evidence to a grand jury
for review.

Authorities declined to identify the officers involved.
