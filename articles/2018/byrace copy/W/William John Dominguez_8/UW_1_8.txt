The Stillwater Police Department has identified the two officers who shot and killed William John Dominguez, 31,

the night of March 28.  

After the Payne County District Attorney's Office declared the shooting "justified, appropriate and necessary,"

Micheal Casteel and Trevor Meridith have been named as the two officers who fatally shot Dominguez, according

to a press release from SPD Capt. Kyle Gibbs on Thursday.Â   

Casteel and Meridith, 8- and 9-year veterans of the department, respectively, responded to Dominguez' 911 call in

which he told dispatcher Vanessa Prince he had a gun and knife in his possession and was thinking of jumping

into oncoming traffic.  

As Casteel and Meridith approached Dominguez, Dominguez reportedly pulled a pistol and a knife from his pants,

posing "an immediate deadly threat to the officers as well as any pedestrians, traffic and apartment occupants in

the immediate vicinity," according to the release.  

Four gunshots rang out, and Dominguez fell to the ground, fatally wounded.  

"The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was asked to conduct the criminal investigation into the officer

involved shooting," Gibbs wrote in the release. "Their case was presented to the Payne County District Attorney

who determined the use of deadly force in this incident was justified, appropriate and necessary. The Stillwater

P.D. administrative review of the incident also determined the officers responded appropriately to the threat and

their use of lethal force was justified and in accordance with department policy."  

SPD had one contact with Dominguez on March 19, according to the release.  

Dominguez initiated a request for assistance through a third party and was taken into protective custody without

incident and taken for a medical evaluation, according to the release.  

Casteel and Meridith have been cleared to return to work as SPD officers.
