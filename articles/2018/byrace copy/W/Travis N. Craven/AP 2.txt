According to the letter, Craven fled from deputies while armed and after assaulting his father in the
Red Feather Lakes area early last month.

Craven's vehicle later spun out and landed in a field.

Riedel says Bordewick repeatedly demanded for Craven to drop the gun, but he had his finger on
the trigger as he turned toward the deputy.

A toxicology report showed Craven had methamphetamine in his system.
