OGDEN — A man shot to death by police Friday night had charged officers with a softball-size rock, Ogden Police

Chief Randy Watt said. 

Police identified the man as Christopher William Parrish, 33, who last lived in Arizona. At a press conference

Saturday afternoon, Watt said police do not know why Parrish was in Ogden. 

Parrish has a criminal record in Arizona and Oregon, including a conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly

weapon, police said in a press release Saturday. 

Parrish had tattoos signifying two white supremacist prison gangs, Soldiers of Aryan Culture and Silent Aryan

Warriors, Watt said. 

Watt said police were called to the Walmart at 20th Street and Wall Avenue Friday evening for a report that a man

was threatening customers. He left in a vehicle and police pulled him over. 

The man gave vague information and then sped away, crashed, and ran away, the chief said. In a yard off 21st

Street, Parrish picked up a rock, turned and "rapidly and violently attacked" the two officers. 

They fired Tasers at him but the stun guns were ineffective, Watt said. He continued to attack and they both fired

their service handguns, killing him, the chief said. 

Neither officer was injured, according to Watt. He said he did not know whether Parrish ever struck the officers

with the rock. 

"These things are unfortunate, but they do happen," Watt said. 

The chief said he did not know whether Parrish made any racially tinged threats in the store or against the officers.

Watt said all officers involved in the case Friday are white.

The chief said police notified Parrish's mother of the death. 

"We express our condolences to the family," Watt said. 

The Utah Office of the Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on Parrish's body Saturday afternoon, Watt said.

The chief said toxicology tests are pending. 

Per procedure, the two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal affairs

investigation and a police shooting review by the Weber County Attorney's Office, Watt said.
