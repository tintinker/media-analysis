T he Cass County Prosecutor's Office will not seek criminal charges against three Cass County
Sheriff's Department deputies who shot at and killed a Walton man last month who police say was
armed with a knife.

Prosecutor Lisa Swaim said in a news release Thursday that after a thorough examination that
involved 911 recordings, witness statements and the testimonies of the deputies themselves, her
office determined the police action shooting was legally justifiable.

T he announcement comes less than a month after the Jan. 27 shooting. Early that morning, CCSD
deputies were called to a house in the 600 block of Carol Drive in Walton on a report that WilliamWilliam
Pollard Jr., 45, was stabbing himself with a steak knife.

T he release went on to state that Pollard stabbed himself as a result of about a week without food
or sleep and after seeing and hearing hallucinations caused by an overdose of methamphetamine.

When police arrived on scene, Pollard was armed with a steak knife, the release stated, and ignored
repeated orders to stop and drop the weapon.

Instead, Swaim wrote in the release, Pollard began walking toward the deputies, spurring police to
fatally shoot him.

Pending investigation into the shooting, Sgt. Pat Zeider, Deputy Ryan Preston and Reserve Deputy
Gary Baumgardner were all placed on administrative leave. Sheriff Randy Pryor said on T hursday
that the department has plans for the three to return to work, but that decision won't be
immediate.

"T hey will be going back to work at some point in the future," he said. "We'll be glad to get them
back, and we're looking forward to it."
