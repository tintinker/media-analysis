Police responding to 911 call use lethal force

What happened: A 40-year-old man named Lemuel B unn
Lemuel Bunn held his pregnant girlfriend in her
Fayetteville apartment for hours, even after he stabbed her. Police answered her 911 call by
breaking in and, when Bunn refused to drop a knife, fatally shooting him, according to Chief Gina
Hawkins.

Why it matters: Hawkins said Tuesday after the incident that it appeared her officers did everything
"on-point." State investigators will review their actions, which is standard in police shootings, and
the officer who fired the shot will remain on administrative duty until then.
