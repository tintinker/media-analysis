NASHVILLE, T enn. (AP) — A Nashville judge says attorneys for a white police officer charged in the
shooting death of a black man can introduce parts of the man's criminal history at a preliminary
hearing next month.

T he Tennessean reports General Sessions Judge Melissa Blackburn ruled Friday the defense can
bring up previous "aggressive acts" by the 25-year-old Daniel H ambrick
against the motion, saying there is no evidence Officer Andrew Delke, also 25, knew about the past
charges.

Daniel H ambrick. Prosecutors argued

Blackburn ruled against allowing Delke to introduce Facebook photos showing Hambrick
"simulating holding a pistol" and evidence that Hambrick used a gun during a target practice.

Delke has been decommissioned while an internal police investigation into the July shooting
remains open.

At the preliminary hearing next month, Blackburn will decide if the case is strong enough to send to
the grand jury.

Delke's legal team is preparing to argue the officer acted in self defense because he saw Hambrick
holding a gun. Prosecutors have not challenged the fact that Hambrick was armed, but they have
rejected a self-defense argument. T hey note in the warrant that Delke stopped chasing Hambrick
before taking aim and opening fire.

Blackburn agreed Friday to let the defense question expert witnesses about police training that
might have guided Delke's actions.

An autopsy showed Hambrick was hit three times, twice in the back and once in the back of the
head.
