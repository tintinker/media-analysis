NASHVILLE, T enn. (AP) â€” An attorney has entered a not guilty plea for a white Nashville police
officer indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the fatal shooting of an armed black man.

Defense attorney David Raybin entered the plea Wednesday for officer Andrew Delke in Davidson
County Criminal Court. Delke didn't appear in court for Wednesday's arraignment.

Delke shot 25-year-old Daniel H ambrick

Daniel Hambrick from behind during a foot chase in July.

T he defense has argued Delke followed his training and state law in shooting after he saw
Hambrick had a gun. District Attorney General Glenn Funk has said Delke could have sought cover
and called for help.

A grand jury indicted Delke in January.

Delke's case is slated for another hearing T uesday.
