car dealership, an official said. 

The Northwest Indiana Major Crimes Task Force, which is investigating the officer-involved shooting at the request

of Merrillville police, aims to wrap up its report next week and submit the case to the Lake County prosecutor's

office, Greg Mance, task force chairman, said. 

Jimmy Terry, 30, of Sioux Falls, S.D., died Wednesday after he was shot by police in the parking lot of Art Hill Ford

Lincoln dealership at 901 W. Lincoln Highway, according to Mance and the Lake County coroner's office.

entrance, he said. 

The man "disregarded the officers' lawful commands and less lethal force," Mance said in a release Friday. Mance

said police used a stun gun on Terry, but it "was ineffective in subduing the subject as he continued his resistive

and armed approach towards the officers," according to Mance. 

Police then used lethal force and shot the man, he said. Terry was taken to Methodist Hospitals Southlake where

he died, Mance said. The coroner's office ruled his death a homicide. 

"Investigators of the task force have interviewed numerous witnesses and collected several articles of evidence

related to this case," Mance said in a release Friday. 

Mance confirmed that a knife was recovered from the scene. 

A question to Mance on whether the stun gun was used while Terry was inside or outside the vehicle was not

immediately answered Friday.
