Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo confirmed that Hill was struck by a bullet fired by
another officer that came through a wall.

Hill was part of a nine-person task force that was serving a warrant at 1837 Mulberry St. in the
early hours of Jan. 18 to arrest Shayla T owles Pierce. Once officers knocked on the door, entered
the home and arrested Pierce, Hill went into the back of the house, to clear the rest of the first
floor.

While he was in the back dining room, Kevin Sturg is
which faces the front of the home.

Kevin Sturg is  emerged from the second-floor stairwell,

“Are you looking for me?” Sturgis shouted from the stairs before descending and opening fire.

A York city officer was struck in the elbow by Sturgis’ first bullet, Chardo said. T hat prompted
another officer to return fire at Sturgis.

At least two bullets penetrated the wall behind Sturgis, ending up in the dining room where Hill was.

T ask force members who were inside the house retreated through the rear door, according to
Chardo’s statement.

As task force members tended to the wounded, Sturgis exited the front door of the house, Chardo
said, and continued to fire on officers, striking a Harrisburg officer in the chest.

A bullet resistant vest saved his life.

Sturgis was later shot to death in the ensuing gunbattle in the street.

Chardo said his investigation has been completed and that officers were justified in using deadly
force against Sturgis.
