Conflicting accounts were surrounding a police shooting that killed a Black man in Chicago
Wednesday night, with some suggesting officers were trying to cover it up.

What police described to the Chicago Tribune as "an armed encounter between the offender and
police" in the Bronzeville section of the city was actually an execution, with officers shooting
M aurice Granton, Jr., in the back as he ran away, according to reports on social media.

Adding to the confusion was police claiming that Granton had a gun and pointed it at them before
running, but Granton's family has said the gun that was "recovered" did not belong to him.

"Since when does running validate somebody getting shot?"Joanna Varnado, Granton's sister,
asked rhetorically. "I don't understand that. You're not being offensive, you're being defensive."

Granton, 24, was the father of two daughters.

"I just want to know what the real story is," Varnado told the T ribune. "If it was misconduct, I want
justice. My brother was 24 years old. He loved his girls. T hat's all he lived for, was his kids."

T he mother of Granton's daughters also said he did not carry a gun.

"He didn't have no gun on him. He has two kids to live for, so he wouldn't do anything dumb. He
come home to his kids every night," T ayshia Shaw told CBS Chicago. "T hat's not his personality.
He wouldn't even chance his life doing that, knowing he has two very young kids to come home
to."

According to a USA Today report from 2016, "Black people have been killed in police chases at a
rate nearly three times higher than everyone else."

If reports of Granton being shot in the back turn out to be true, the officer(s) who shot him could
be indicted for murder charges, if historical precedence is any indication. Former North Charleston
Police Officer Michael Slager was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for shooting
Walter Scott in the back. At the time of the shooting, Scott was fleeing on foot.

T he Chicago Police Department has long has a reputation for police brutality and overall
corruption, including some new wrongful convictions that were reported by the Associated Press
just this week.

"We've had all kinds of police corruption, we've had police torture cases, but we've never had so
many cases where there is clear evidence that police actually set people up for crimes they didn't

commit," Marshall Hatch, a minister and activist in Chicago, told the AP on Sunday.
