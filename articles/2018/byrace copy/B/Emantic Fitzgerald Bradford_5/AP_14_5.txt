in the Alabama attorney general's neighborhood to protest his taking over the investigation.  

The group of about a dozen people went from Birmingham to Montgomery on Sunday to protest in the reported

neighborhood of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, news outlets reported.  

Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., 21, was shot and killed by a Hoover police officer who responded to a shooting at

the Riverchase Galleria on Thanksgiving night. Bradford had a gun when he was shot by an officer.  

Investigators later determined that someone else was responsible for the original shooting that injured two people

and have charged Erron Brown, 20, with that shooting.  

Protesters on Sunday night walked through the neighborhood for about an hour, using bullhorns and a siren and

chanting "Recuse yourself" and "Hands up, don't shoot." They want the case returned to the local district attorney

or someone else.  

Montgomery police officers talked to the group and the protest ended a short time later. No arrests were made.  

A captain told protesters, "I know what you're here for and I don't have a problem with it," but said officers had

received complaints from residents. The group was told they needed to obtain a permit for the protest. Organizers

have said they would protest every night until Marshall responded to them.  

Marshall took over the investigation Dec. 13 because of a possible conflict of interest for local District Attorney

Danny Carr and those involved in the case.  

A spokesman for the attorney general had not comment on the protest.
