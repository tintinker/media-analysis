Hoover Police shot Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., an African American male, stating he was an active shooter in

the Galleria Mall. Just hours later they admitted to mistakenly identifying him. (via AL.com) 

We offer our condolences to Bradford's family and friends. Black and brown people shouldn't have to live in

constant fear of law enforcement officials who are charged with protecting the public. Implicit bias is entrenched

in police practices that are inherently racist and that culture must change. 

The ACLU of Alabama expects the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Hoover Police Department to

conduct transparent, unbiased investigations into this tragic death. Accountability of law enforcement agents to

the public is critical given their absolute authority to use lethal force in some circumstances. It is crucial that those

entrusted with that level of authority be committed to using it sparingly, equitably, legally, and in a racially

unbiased way.
