and killed the nightclub security guard—and he will release the name if authorities do not, USA Today reported

independently learned the name of the officer who killed Roberson outside an Illinois bar over the weekend and will

release it to the public by Monday if the authorities haven’t by then. The lawyer also reportedly accused Illinois
